# Apples-Bananas

### Overview
Apples-Bananas was the very first project that I worked on. It is a straightforward HTML, CSS, and JavaScript program that lets a user pick apples or bananas, enter their name, and the website will reveal which fruit they like. It took me about three days to complete this using GitHub pages. 

**If you want to look at the finished website, here is the URL: https://codygima.github.io/apples-bananas/**

## Installation and Usage
### Installation
To install Apples-Bananas, make sure to download [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), then open your local terminal and run the following commands:

1. Clone the Repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/codygima/apples-bananas.git
```
2. Navigate to the Project Directory:
```bash
cd apples-bananas
```
3. Open using Visual Studio Code:
```bash
code .
```
### Usage
To use this program, follow these steps:

1. Install the Live Server extension by Ritwick Dey from the Visual Studio Code Marketplace.
2. Right-click on `index.html` in the Explorer panel.
3. Select "Open with Live Server" from the context menu.

Your default browser should open the project on a live server that updates in real-time. Now you can see how I made this simple website and can make slight changes to the code to discover what can be done with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript!

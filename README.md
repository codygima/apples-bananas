# Apples-Bananas

### Overview
Apples-Bananas was the very first project that I worked on. It is a straightforward HTML, CSS, and JavaScript program that lets a user pick apples or bananas, enter their name, and the website will reveal which fruit they like. It took me about three days to complete this using GitHub pages. 

**If you want to look at the finished website, here is the URL: https://codygima.github.io/apples-bananas/**
